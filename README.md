mpaluchowski WordPress Theme
============================

This is the custom [WordPress](http://www.wordpress.org/) theme I use for my blog at http://michal.paluchowski.com/. It's mostly tailored to my needs and preferences, although I try to keep it flexible and configurable.

Features
--------

* self-contained - doesn't rely on external widgets or plug-ins; all customizations are within the theme's code
* responsive design - for desktops, tablets and mobile phones
* HTML5 and CSS3
* Schema.org and Microformats markup
* AddThis sharing widgets
